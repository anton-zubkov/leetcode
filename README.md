# 🧠 Algorithm Practice & LeetCode Solutions

Welcome! This repository contains my personal solutions to algorithmic challenges, mostly from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), as well as various data structure and algorithm implementations.

> ✍️ This is my sandbox for learning, experimenting, and sharpening problem-solving skills in Java (and possibly other languages in the future).

📦 Contents
•	✅ LeetCode solutions with readable, clean Java code
•	📚 Implementations of core data structures for practice and understanding
•	🧪 Unit tests using JUnit 5
•	🛠️ Utility classes for debugging, printing, and verifying algorithms
