# 🧠 Algorithm Practice & LeetCode Solutions

Welcome! This repository contains my personal solutions to algorithmic challenges, mostly from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), as well as various data structure and algorithm implementations.

> ✍️ This is my sandbox for learning, experimenting, and sharpening problem-solving skills in Java (and possibly other languages in the future).

## 📦 Contents

- ✅ **LeetCode solutions** with readable, clean Java code
- 📚 **Implementations of core data structures** for practice and understanding
- 🧪 **Unit tests** using JUnit 5
- 🛠️ **Utility classes** for debugging, printing, and verifying algorithms
